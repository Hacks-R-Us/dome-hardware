# dome-hardware
Bits of pcb and 3D model for the dome controllers, strips, and dome covering.
 * PCB: Power and network goes in, WS2812 protocol comes out.
 * Shims: go on PCB to stop things touching.
 * Toothpicks: go in ends of WS2812 strips and cable tie the cables to them to reduce strain on the strip ends.
 * Sheets: Patterns to cut (5 of) to make your dome into a covered dome. These are the raw patterns with none of the seams drawn. Good luck.


## Jankyness ##
Yes, very. Some parts (such as pin bodges in the schematics) are very dirty hacks, even you can even call them that.

## Do I need the softwarey things to open the stuff? ##
 * Yes.
 * FreeCAD
 * KiCAD

## How to make things ##
 * PCBs: We used:
   *  jlcpcb for the PCBs, they were cheap and fast and it worked.
   *  Ebay for the parts. they were also cheap and fast and they worked.
 * 3D printed bits:
   * We used a Prusa i3MK3s for the 3D printed parts. It was expensive and slow and it worked. Really. printing 500 toothpicks took days.
   * Conveniently someone had Covid at the time so didn't go outside and could ensure the house didn't burn down. Thanks :)
 * For the covering, we used:
   * Sharpies
   * 3.8Oz/sqM waterproof ripstop nylon. (unknown amount maybe 30-40 meters of 1.5 wide?)
   * A giant compass...
   * plastic tent grommet/eyelets
   * 0.38mm thread (too thick!)
   * London hackspace's sewing machine.
   * ...later superseeded by stick with rusty nail and holes drilled at size of sharpie and length in drawing
   * A straight edge
   * Some LX tape (1 roll does it), and a LOT of time.
   * After measuring the first set out,  we stuck it to the floor and the ripstop was thin enough it worked like tracing paper to draw the points...
   * This is probably the worst way of doing it.
   * A LOT OF TIME. REALLY. A LOT. WEEKS. (would have helped if we knew how to sew to start with!)

## "I have a better way of..." ##
Nice. if it's elegant of slightly better, do a PR or something...
